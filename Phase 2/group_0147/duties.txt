- (Felix) I helped create the basis of automatic ordering and manual ordering in Cashiers, which centralized upon opening a file, reading a file,and editing a file. Anything file-related, I first coded it and corrected the code with the help of both Jasper and Sam. This means I made the initial text files for the different histories such as OrderHistory, PriceHistory and SaleHistory. I also contributed to a majority of the Javadocs and helped create the UML diagram as well.

- (Jasper) I coded a majority of the functions of the program that mainly contributed to the user functions from the Cashier, Manager, Receiver and Reshelver classes. I contributed to creating of the events.txt and log.txt file. I corrected and fixed many functions due to the creation of the events.txt and other test files to make sure everything worked. I helped write the Javadocs and UML diagrams. I also was in charge of making the different outputs such as the print statements more user-friendly to read.

- (Sam) I created the infrastructure of the code deciding how many classes to have and what each class should be in charge of. I was the main contributor to writing the events.txt file as well as the help.txt file to explain how to use each of the functions. I was in charge of the overall set-up of the Store and how to re-arrange any items and sections to other aisles. I did most of the editing of the code within the group to make sure everything worked.
