# SuperMarket
Project that imitates a supermarket inventory.

This was a project created in class with 2 other classmates that allowed imitation of a potential supermarket business.

The program allows for different groups of employees to access different functions of the Supermarket. There were managers, cashiers, etc.
Items were created and stored into different sections of the supermarket under different categories. Stockers would input delivery and 
amounts of items put into the system for cashiers to scan through. Cashiers would scan through items using either a UPC code or find the 
name of the item. Profits and revenue can be accessed through the manager.
